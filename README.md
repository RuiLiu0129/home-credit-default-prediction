The LightGBM library is used to implement a gradient boosting decision tree algorithm with Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS).
This novel technique was introduced by the Microsoft Research team and is described in [this paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6907-lightgbm-a-highly-efficient-gradient-boosting-decision-tree.pdf).

## Installation

1. Install Python 3 with pip
2. Clone repository and install requirements

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

3. Change the path variables at the config.py file

4. Run the main file

```python main.py```

### Dependencies

- Python 3
- Numpy
- Sklearn
- Lightgbm
- Hyperopt

The code was tested with Python 3.6 on a Windows 7 machine and Python 3.5 on Ubuntu 16 LTS.
